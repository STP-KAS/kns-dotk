# Community risk

**Not an audit.** Owner note, 15 Sep 2026.

## Risk

Kaspa community who have minted KNS domains will likely not appreciate the effort.

People already paid KNS fees, hold `.kas` inscriptions, and type those names in wallets. A parallel `.k` registrar — or a mix that looks like it replaces them — will read as a raid on that installed base, even when the uniqueness engineering is real.

## Initiative

This desk understands the initiative. SuperTypo is right that KNS uniqueness is an indexer rule, not a node rule. Gap covering of `blake3(name)` is the uniqueness KNS never had.

That does not make a second TLD welcome to the people who already minted.

## Advice: work with KNS

Do not ship a silent second namespace as the default. Bind, don’t alias. If uniqueness v2 happens, it should be **with** the installed `.kas` base, not against it.

- Keep `.kas` as the human string.
- Offer a bind (owner of `alice.kas` may mint the v2 deed). Never auto-map `.kas` → `.k`.
- Publish `.sil`. Argue the template in the open.
- Do not take fees on a competing TLD and call that “fixing KNS.”
